## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user input on the server side
   - Use prepared statements (Eloquent ORM) for all database queries — never raw SQL
   - Sanitize output to prevent XSS

2. **Authentication**
   - Use strong password hashing (`bcrypt` / `argon2`)
   - Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
   - Enforce 2FA for admin accounts

3. **Authorization**
   - Use Role-Based Access Control (Spatie Permission) on all protected routes
   - Validate permissions at every API endpoint
   - Never trust client-provided IDs without ownership verification

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use HTTPS everywhere (enforce in production)
   - Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII)

5. **Dependencies**
   - Keep Composer and npm packages up to date
   - Review dependency audit reports regularly:
     ```bash
     npm audit
     composer audit
     ```

### For Users

1. Use a strong, unique password for your account
2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in account settings
3. Do not share your API tokens or session cookies
4. Log out of shared or public devices after use
5. Report any suspicious activity immediately
