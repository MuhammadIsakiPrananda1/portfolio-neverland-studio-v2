## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### 💻 For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user input on the server side using FormRequests.
   - Use prepared statements (Eloquent ORM) for all database queries — never raw SQL.
   - Sanitize output to prevent XSS.

2. **Authentication**
   - Use strong password hashing (`bcrypt` / `argon2`).
   - Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints.
   - Enforce **2FA** for admin accounts.

3. **Authorization**
   - Use Role-Based Access Control (Spatie Permission) on all protected routes.
   - Validate permissions at every API endpoint.
   - Never trust client-provided IDs without ownership verification.

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest.
   - Use HTTPS everywhere (enforce in production).
   - Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII).

5. **Dependencies**
   - Keep Composer and npm packages up to date.
   - Review dependency audit reports regularly:
     ```bash
     npm audit
     composer audit
     ```

### 👤 For Users

1. Use a **strong, unique password** for your account.
2. Enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** in your account settings.
3. **Do not share** your API tokens or session cookies.
4. **Log out** of shared or public devices after use.
5. Report any suspicious activity immediately.
